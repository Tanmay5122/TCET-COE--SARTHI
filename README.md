## 1) System Overview

The portal serves three authenticated personas plus public visitors:
- Students: register, verify OTP, login, book facilities, participate in innovation
- Faculty: manage content, create and review innovation/hackathon workflows
- Admin: operational moderation, analytics, and platform governance
- Public: browse homepage content and innovation landing/event pages

Major capability groups:
- Public content feed: news, grants, events, announcements, hero slides
- Facility booking: student request lifecycle with admin confirm/reject and reminders
- Innovation platform:
  - Open problems: students maintain reusable profile, answer faculty questions, submit individual applications
  - Faculty application review: select/reject + feedback + notification emails
  - Hackathon track: event registration, staged screening/judging sync, shortlisting tickets, leaderboard
- Admin ops: user directory search by name/email/UID with role filtering (faculty/student)
- Admin ops: custom email broadcasts to specific users, students, faculty, or all users with immediate/bulk delivery and optional attachments
- Industry internships: bulk selection, auto-rejection for non-selected applicants, and problem-based internship workspaces
- Industry internship decisions: review student profiles and resumes alongside applications
- Industry internship decisions: export applications (profile, answers, UID) as CSV for Excel
- Internship project dashboard: create internship problem statements with a required support PDF; pending items are visible to admin/industry dashboards until approved and only approved items show publicly
- Internship workspace: task assignments, group chat, meetings, and document sharing for selected cohorts
- Internship workspace UX: direct file attachments in chat/messages plus document uploads or shareable links in the documents panel
- Internship workspace documents: PDF/image uploads render inline with in-portal previews; other legacy files remain downloadable
- Internship workspace APIs: accepts browser datetime-local values for task deadlines and meeting schedule inputs
- Faculty internships: admin-created faculty opportunities, decisions workflow, and shared faculty internship workspaces
- Faculty profiles: department/designation, expertise, resume, and professional links
- Profile completion prompts for students and faculty
- Admin user directory CSV export with year/branch filters

### 4.2 Session lifecycle

- Login sets `accessToken` (short-lived) and `refreshToken` (long-lived)
- Login and refresh also set `coe_shared_token` for cross-subdomain dashboard auth
- Protected APIs validate token via cookie or bearer token
- Refresh endpoint rotates access token
- Logout clears auth cookies
- Page-level redirects enforce role boundaries

## 5) Data Model

Primary entities:
- `User` (role/status/verification)
- `Otp` (verification/reset OTP)
- `Booking`
- `NewsPost`
- `Grant`
- `Event`
- `Announcement`
- `HeroSlide`
- `HackathonEvent`
- `Problem`
- `Claim`
- `ClaimMember`
- `StudentProfile`
- `ProblemQuestion`
- `Application`
- `ApplicationAnswer`
- `InternshipTask`, `InternshipMessage`, `InternshipMeeting`, `InternshipDocument` (problem-scoped internship workspaces)
- `EmailJob`

Key innovation enums and lifecycle:
- `ProblemMode`: `OPEN`, `CLOSED`
- `ProblemStatus`: `OPENED`, `CLOSED`, `ARCHIVED`
- `ApplicationStatus`: `SUBMITTED`, `SELECTED`, `REJECTED`
- `ClaimStatus`: `IN_PROGRESS`, `SUBMITTED`, `SHORTLISTED`, `ACCEPTED`, `REVISION_REQUESTED`, `REJECTED`
- `EventStatus`: `UPCOMING`, `ACTIVE`, `JUDGING`, `CLOSED`
  - operational transition flow currently used: `UPCOMING -> ACTIVE -> JUDGING -> CLOSED`

Scoring fields persisted on `Claim` for hackathon judging:
- `innovationScore`, `technicalScore`, `impactScore`, `uxScore`, `executionScore`, `presentationScore`, `feasibilityScore`
- `finalScore` and `score`
- `isAbsent` is the judging gate used during sync validation

Attendance fields persisted for member-level check-in:
- `TicketAttendance.status`: `NOT_PRESENT`, `PRESENT`
- `TicketAttendance.markedAt` and `markedByUserId` capture attendance audit metadata

Open-problem application fields persisted on `Application`:
- `status`: `SUBMITTED`, `SELECTED`, `REJECTED`
- `feedback`: faculty decision notes
- profile linkage via `profileId`
- custom responses via `ApplicationAnswer`

Internship workspaces:
- Internships are modeled as `Problem` rows with `problemType = INTERNSHIP`.
- Selected participants are derived from `Application` with `status = SELECTED`.
- Workspace collaboration data (tasks/messages/meetings/documents) references the internship `Problem` directly.

```

Open-problem application fields persisted on `Application`:

Public/common pages:
- `/`
- `/about`
- `/laboratory`
- `/innovation`
- `/innovation/events/[id]`

Auth pages:
- `/login`
- `/forgot-password`

Protected pages:
- `/facility-booking` (student)
- `/faculty` (faculty/admin)
- `/admin` (admin)
- `/admin?tab=innovation` (admin hackathon control center)
- `/innovation/problems` (student/faculty/admin)
- `/innovation/profile` (student)
- `/innovation/my-applications` (student)
- `/innovation/my-submissions` (student)
- `/innovation/faculty` (faculty/admin)
- `/innovation/faculty/problems/create` (faculty/admin)
- `/innovation/faculty/applications` (faculty/admin)

Navigation and access behavior:
- Navbar is role-aware (faculty/admin links hidden from unauthorized users)
- Admin account menu includes `Hackathon Control Center` shortcut to `/admin?tab=innovation`
- Login supports `next` redirect for student return flow
- Admin/faculty pages hard-redirect unauthorized users

Route mapping for this flow:
- Innovation landing page: `/innovation`
- Event detail page: `/innovation/events/[id]`
- Faculty workspace: `/innovation/faculty`

### 6.2 Open problem application page-level flow

```

Current UX notes:
- Students are prompted globally to complete profile before applying (`ProfileCompletionModal`).
- Faculty open-problem review runs in `/innovation/faculty/applications`.
- Legacy open-submissions compatibility endpoints were removed; application routes are now canonical.

## 8) Environment Configuration

Required variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/coe_main"
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="change-me-access"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="change-me-refresh"

ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@tcetmumbai.in"
ADMIN_PASSWORD="AdminPassword123"
ADMIN_NAME="CoE Admin"

SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-google-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-google-client-secret"
GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN="your-google-refresh-token"
SMTP_FROM="TCET CoE <noreply@tcetmumbai.in>"

CRON_SECRET="change-me-cron-secret"
EMAIL_MAX_ATTEMPTS="5"
EMAIL_PRIORITY_IMMEDIATE="100"
EMAIL_PRIORITY_BULK="20"
COOKIE_SECURE="false"

MINIO_ENDPOINT="localhost"
MINIO_PORT=9000
MINIO_ACCESS_KEY="minioadmin"
MINIO_SECRET_KEY="minioadmin"
MINIO_USE_SSL=false
MINIO_BUCKET="coe-assets"

NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID="G-XXXXXXXXXX"
```

OAuth2 mail security notes:
- Configure `SMTP_USER`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in your local `.env`/`.env.local` only.
- Do not commit client secrets, refresh tokens, or access tokens into `README.md` or any tracked file.
- Nodemailer automatically generates and refreshes access tokens from `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN`; no manual `access_token` variable is required.

Optional variables:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
- `FRONTEND_URL`
- `MINIO_USE_PROXY=true|false`
- `COOKIE_SECURE=true|false` (set `false` for HTTP development, `true` for HTTPS production)

## 9) Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run db:migrate:status
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
```

No-reset migration workflow (recommended):

```bash
# 1) change prisma/schema.prisma

# 2) create migration SQL from current DB -> schema (no reset)
npm run db:migrate:create -- --name describe_change

# 3) apply pending migrations without reset
npm run db:migrate
```

Important:
- Do not run `npx prisma migrate dev` for routine apply operations in this repository.
- Use `npm run db:migrate` (`prisma migrate deploy`) to apply safely without reset prompts.
- Create forward-only migrations; do not edit already-applied migration files.

Validation:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Seed admin account:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed
```

## 10) Analytics (GA4)

Integration overview:
- GA script is mounted in the root layout through `@next/third-parties/google`
- Event dispatch uses a shared helper in `src/lib/analytics.ts`
- Analytics calls are wrapped to avoid blocking UI behavior
- Event payloads intentionally avoid PII (no raw names/emails/passwords)

Tracked events:
- `login` and `login_failed`
- `sign_up` and `sign_up_failed`
- `hackathon_register`
- `innovation_registration_failed`
- `booking_created`
- `booking_failed`
- `booking_cancelled`
- `content_viewed` (news, grants, announcements, events)
- `hero_cta_clicked`

Quick validation in GA DebugView:
- Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` in `.env.local`
- Run the app locally and trigger login/register, booking, and innovation actions
- Verify events appear in GA4 DebugView with expected non-PII parameters

    RH->>RESP: Success envelope
  else Not Authorized
    RH-->>C: 403 Forbidden
  end

  RESP-->>C: JSON Response
```

MinIO transport:
- Supports host-style and URL-style endpoint values
- For HTTPS app + HTTP MinIO, use storage proxy route (`/api/storage/[...path]`)

Cookies:
- `httpOnly=true`
- `sameSite=lax`
- `secure=true` in production

SMTP:
- For Gmail, use app password and SMTP-enabled account settings

### 11.1 Docker Deployment (App + MySQL)

Docker files included in repository:
- `Dockerfile`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.dockerignore`
- `.env.docker.example`
- `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh`

Steps:
1. Copy environment template.
```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker
```
2. Update `.env.docker` with real secrets and infrastructure values (SMTP, MinIO, JWT, GA).
3. Build and start services.
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker up --build -d
```
4. Check logs.
```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.docker logs -f app
```
5. Open app at `http://localhost:3000`.

Useful operations:
```bash
# stop containers
docker compose --env-file .env.docker down

# stop containers and remove DB volume
docker compose --env-file .env.docker down -v

# run migrations manually
docker compose --env-file .env.docker exec app npx prisma migrate deploy
```

Notes:
- `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.docker` must use host `db` (compose service name) for local compose networking.
- App startup runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically when `RUN_MIGRATIONS=true`.
- For external managed MySQL, remove/disable the `db` service in compose and set `DATABASE_URL` to external host.

Booking reminder job:
- Endpoint: `GET /api/cron/reminder`
- Behavior:
  - reminders for confirmed bookings starting in next 30 minutes
  - marks `reminderSent=true`
  - cleans expired OTP records

Innovation reminder job:
- Endpoint: `GET /api/cron/innovation-reminder`
- Behavior:
  - broadcasts UPCOMING future-event announcements to all ACTIVE students
  - transitions `UPCOMING -> ACTIVE` when start time is reached
  - sends active-phase notifications to registered participants at activation
  - sends ending reminders to registered participants
  - does not auto-close events; closure is a manual status control
- Optional targeting:
  - `mode=UPCOMING_ALL_STUDENTS` for upcoming broadcasts only
  - `mode=ACTIVATE_REGISTERED` for activation + registered participant active emails only
  - `mode=ENDING_REMINDER` for ending reminders only
  - `eventId=<id>` to scope any mode to one hackathon event
- Examples:
  - `GET /api/cron/innovation-reminder?mode=UPCOMING_ALL_STUDENTS`
  - `GET /api/cron/innovation-reminder?mode=UPCOMING_ALL_STUDENTS&eventId=12`
  - `GET /api/cron/innovation-reminder?mode=ACTIVATE_REGISTERED&eventId=12`

Operational health:
- `GET /api/health`

## 13) Security Model

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt
- Access/refresh token secrets from environment
- Route guards use centralized `authenticate()` + `authorize()`
- Forgot-password flow uses non-enumerating response behavior
- Password reset requires valid OTP within TTL window
- Role-based page redirects reduce unauthorized surface area in UI

### 14.1 Common HTTP Status Codes & Handling

```mermaid

    200["200 OK<br/>Request successful"]
    201["201 Created<br/>Resource created"]
  end

```
- Access token expired; refresh flow should issue a new access token

Mixed-content or broken media URLs:
- Use `/api/storage/[...path]` proxy for non-SSL MinIO setups

`/api/seed` returns `405`:
- Use `POST`, not `GET`

Leaderboard endpoint failing:
- Verify event status is `CLOSED`

Final judging sync failing:
- Ensure event status is not `UPCOMING`
- Ensure only present shortlisted claims are included
- If a shortlisted team was marked absent, mark it present first
- Ensure all rubric fields are present

Application decision not visible in student portal:
- Ensure review status for the application is `SELECTED` or `REJECTED`
- Confirm student checks `/innovation/my-applications` (or `GET /api/innovation/applications/my`)
- If email is missing, verify SMTP configuration; status updates still persist even if mail fails

Prisma migrate drift warning after editing historical migrations:
- Prisma may require a dev database reset to reconcile history
- Prefer creating a new forward migration instead of editing an already-applied migration file

Avoiding "All data will be lost" reset prompts:
- Use `npm run db:migrate:create -- --name <change_name>` for new migration files
- Use `npm run db:migrate` to apply pending migrations safely
- Avoid `npx prisma migrate dev` unless you intentionally accept reset behavior in throwaway environments

Before release:
- `npm run build`
- Verify auth flows (register, OTP verify, login, forgot/reset password)
- Verify student booking lifecycle and admin moderation
- Verify faculty content create/update/delete flows with uploads
- Verify innovation two-stage flow:
  - registration/submission
  - screening sync and shortlist decision emails
  - team ticket issuance to leader after shortlisting
  - member attendance marking from team ticket
  - judging sync with rubric scoring for present teams
  - event close result emails with score/rank + leaderboard output
- Verify open-problem application flow:
  - student profile completion gate before apply
  - application submission with dynamic problem questions
  - faculty/admin review via applications lane
  - student decision visibility in My Applications
  - selection/rejection emails are sent (best-effort)
- Verify reminder cron endpoints
- Ensure `.env` secrets are not committed
